# SIMD Image Filters

For this project, we implemented some image filters in pure x86-64 (Intel) assembly leveraging SIMD instruction-level parallelism.

This insanity was written for the "Computer Organization" course, taught during the first semester of 2019 at the Faculty of Natural and Exact Sciences, University of Buenos Aires.
